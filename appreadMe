step 1: 

install ngrok

step 2:

nun ngrok terminal add add comand for localhost port 80

-ngrok http 80

step 3:
create a folder inside xampp folder and move install.php, token.php, and inc/functions.php in that folder


step 4:
login in your shopify partner account and create a private app
https://partners.shopify.com/


step 5: 

step up your app token and app secret in install.php and token.php


step 6:

get Forwarding url from ngrok note(this is generated when you run ngrok http 80)


step 7:

now put forwarding url with shop url without https or http and backslash

like my localhost forwarding url is :  https://e30c-223-190-85-128.in.ngrok.io

and my shop url is : https://centire5.myshopify.com/

and i have to run https://e30c-223-190-85-128.in.ngrok.io/app_name/?shop=centire5.myshopify.com


for more you can see in app and app2 folter and in attachment
